I finished the book [Design for Hackers](http://designforhackers.com) a few
days ago. I haven't read a lot of books about design so i'm kind of lacking an
objective point of view. But for me it was a really great reading experience
and totally not what i expected. My expectation was to learn some nifty tricks
and be able to create stunning designs in no time. But as always it seems to be
kind of work intense to get good at something.

So back to the book. [David Kadavy](http://kadavy.net) takes an interesting
aproach to shift your persective on design. He talks about the layers of
design, a concept that includes all the parts of a creation and their influence
on the final outcome. He illustrates the concept by taking you on a journey
through history starting with the
[Pantheon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome) in Rome and heading to the
modern font designs like [Georgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)).
Along the way he describes various concepts of design that apply to any given
example and the commonalities between them.

The key thing i learned from this book is that every piece of work tries to
commutincate a message and that visual design is only there to help make it's point
more clear. As well as being beautiful and appealing can help to get a message more
widespread.

Another thing i realized reading this book is that it's hard to come up with
ideas to make something more beautiful. For example this site is kind of ugly
right now. I don't like the overall appearance. But at least it's design does
(hopefully) not prevent the content to convey it's messge.

If anyone would like to help just send me an [email](mailto:mail@julien-gantner.de).
I'd like to keep the light background and hate the ugly default link colors but
i have no idea for an color scheme. Any help appreciated!
