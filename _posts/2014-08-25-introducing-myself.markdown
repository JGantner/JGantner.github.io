Hello Internets!

As the title implies this is a short introduction to this site and myself. So
why should you care about this site? To be honest i don't know at the moment.
My reason to build this site is to experiment a bit with [Github
Pages][github-pages] and [Jekyll][jekyll].

But as you are reading on let introduce myself. My name is Julien Gantner and
i'm a developer located in southern germany. At the moment i'm doing a lot of web
stuff but i consider myself more as a guy that likes to create things or
services that solve more problems as they cause.

To make this site kind of usefull i plan to share some of my experiences with
the stuff i'm working with. I use a lot of tools and technologies from frontend
stuff like html, css or javascript to some more backend related things like
databases, ruby (my language of choice) or infrastructure stuff like
configureing services or machines with tools like chef or puppet.

I'm kind of obsessed with learning stuff and i invest a decent amount of my
time to get better in what i do or learn new things. Along the way i read a lot
of books or do tutorials. I plan to recommend some things that helped me to
make it easier for others to find the good stuff.

A final word to the langauge i'm using here. I am german and therefore english
is not my first language. But i write in english because of the fact that most
people on the net can at least consume english texts. And being a lazy person
i want to make the information on this site accessible to as many people as
possible with the lowest amount of work on my side. If you find some strange
sentences or any typos please let me know by sending me an
[email](mailto: mail@julien-gantner.de), [open an issue][issues] on the github page for
this site or submit a pull request with corrected texts.

I apreaciate any help to look less stupid on the web.

Thanks for reading that far :) and enjoy some of the other content that will
follow.
